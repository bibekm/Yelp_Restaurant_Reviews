So we're both quite familiar with the cuisine, but the dishes here are served with a modern twist, and we were excited! The menu is nice and concise consisting of a snacks/apps section, an entrée section, and desserts.  There is also a tasting menu of $40 per person which includes an appetizer, an entrée, a dessert, as well as an amuse-bouche and a pre-dessert from the chef.  There is also a chef's tasting menu of $80, but reservation in advance is required. \n",

      "I went to Streetcar Po-Boys fully intent on enjoying an authentic Louisiana po-boy.  The restaurant is in a sketchy area of town, literally right next door a strip club.  They're located in a run down building, which still reeks of the days it spent as a Chinese restaurant.  Everything is in disrepair: there is a large piece of plywood in the middle of the front door, perhaps from a prior break-in?, the carpet is worn down to nothingness, the fluorescent lights are overwhelming, and blinding, which exposes and magnifies every fault of the restaurant.  There is nothing cohesive about the interior of this restaurant, and the senses are left confused and probably offended.\n",
      "The menu is decent, it is after all a sandwich shop.  The po-boys all sound enticing, with everything from crawfish and oysters, to turkey and gravy, and even a vegetarian option.  The sweet tea is authentic, and the servers are incredibly warm and welcoming, and after ordering, for a brief moment, you're left feeling optimistic.\n",
      "But here again, the weird, decrepitness of the restaurant messes everything up.  You find yourself sitting in weird booths that seem to have come out of a 1950s diner, being served drinks in Caesar's Palace cups, staring at open shelving that's yellowed over time, and now contains a hodgepodge of low-quality bulk restaurant items.  Heat lamps are hung clumsily from yellow chains, low-quality, inkjet printed signs are posted everywhere, the kitchen doors seem to be bloated from water damage, and there's a pervasive odour of old Chinese food mixed with mould.  It's sad, and I was waiting to see Gordon Ramsey come screaming out of the kitchen, cursing everything.\n",
      "The food, was mediocre at best.  The fried pickles were super oily, the meat used on the sandwiches was the lowest, lowest, lowest quality.  I ordered the \"Ragin Cajun,\" which was to come with turkey, gravy and fries.  I thought it would come with shaved, fresh turkey slices, smothered in hot gravy, and loaded with fries.  Nope.  Two flimsy turkey slices, made from waaaay over processed \"meat,\" and about 5 french fries literally smashed atop the \"meat.\"  It was served warm-ish, with a stingy amount of fries on the side.  The meat was so gross, I couldn't eat it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, with even the slightest investment, this could be a great Las Vegas eatery, but it's location, the building, and the low-quality ingredients make it so I'll never go back, and I certainly won't recommend it to anyone - and in the restaurant industry, that's the kiss of death.\n",
      "\n",

So, if you are just looking to go to a cool place in the area, you won't be disappointed.  If you are interested in spending your money on food and service also, read on...\n",
      "\n",
      "The service here seems to fit a disappointing trend of \"cool\" restaurants.  Staff is very interactive with each other, and not so much with the customers.  Food knowledge is lacking and it feels like bartenders and waiters feel like they are entitled to your 20% tip and trying to figure out if your going to give it to them right away.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food is overpriced and nothing special.  Amount of protein in about every dish is small, clearly to increase profit margin.  Expensive chips and salsas that you pay more for because you get 3 average salsas instead of 1.  I've actually been here for happy hour several times, and the most memorable part is the bill at the end... thinking it really wasn't worth that much.\n",

WHO are you fooling?. \"a non presumptuous and laid back feel\" - are you talking about the right place?\n",
      "\n",
      "With that said, I don't mind the place for a last minute drinks sort of place but even then it would be stretching it. \"Myeh\" - is the first thing that pops into my head when thinking of this place. \n",
      "The venue itself is dimly light with open windows all around. This is a good strategy for both customers and potential customers. Passerby's aren't headed to a specific destination are allured by the casual setting and convenience of walking in without cover/doorman/id checking. The customers are pleased with the transparency through the large windows. It gives the outside feel , embracing all the hoopla the Toronto streets offer without facing the cold.  The low lights mixed with loud music usually seduces the after work type of crowd. Since the venue is extremely tiny, it fills up fast. There's one bar and that is where everyone stands about. I believe this bathroom sized space is also considered the dance floor. The end of the room is filled with however many regular looking table/chair pairs they could manage to fit into this studio room. Bathrooms are downstairs. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's a \"myeh\" local spot for people who live in the area but definitely not worth a return for an 'outsider'. In comparison to the other lounge/dinner/drinks spots College has to offer, this would be ranked below top 30, at best. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing saving this place is the music. It's a live DJ so he's open to requests. For an evening after work, after hustling the corporate streets and downing your 4th -watered down-over priced alcoholic drink, requesting obscure songs is the icing. \n",

      "\n",
      "I go here when i'm waiting my girlfriend to get home from work on mondays and the bartender monday sucks running.  She can't focus on more than one task at once and therefore is constantly flustered which makes for an uncomfortable air in the bar area. I've witnessed one of her meltdowns actually clear a pretty full bar.  Dear owner, this trainwreck is costing you money...you might want to consider upgrading staff.\n",
      "\n",
      "The times she hasn't been there and a capable staffmember has been working has produced fun experiences.  That said, given the location it is what it is:  a yinzer bar bordering a less than desireable area of town and has everything that comes with it.\n",

      "A week and a half ago, I took my beau to Port. I wanted a restaurant that he's never been to, with an awesome patio view seeing as he's a Summer baby. I've been to Port on 3 other occasions but never for dinner. I had went for brunch, drinks and even appetizers so the dinner experience was something I anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I called in for reservations for 7:15 and they told me they could do 7:45. No biggie at all. I'd rather show up and have a table ready then go to the restaurant and have to wait out an available table. I mentioned it was my dude's birthday and I really wanted a patio table but on the website it does clearly state that they do not take reservations for the patio and it's first-come-first-serve. The hostess on the phone said she will note that I want the patio so that if something comes up around that time they will reserve it for me. I greatly appreciated that.\n",
      "\n",
      "About an hour before I was to arrive, I called to double-check on my reservation which they did note and the hostess said \"Yes, we have you down. Would you like us to write Happy Birthday on the cake when you are finished with dinner?\" I really thought was a great gesture as the previous host did make a note mentioning it was for a birthday. Paying attention to your clients...very important!\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmosphere in Port is beautiful. Even in the dining room they have large windows so you can catch glances of the patio view. Dark wood and dim lighting  give it a romantic but lounge-like vibe.  When we arrived, we lucked out and a patio table was reserved for us. My guy was impressed by the beautiful atmosphere as we overlooked the water and saw boats sailing by. Port is situated in Pickering near the beach but the set-up makes you feel like you aren't in Ontario. They also have a fire-pit in the middle of the patio if you just want to sit down and sip on some wine. \n",
      "\n",
      "We weren't interested in any appetizers but we did want to start on the drinks. I originally wanted the \"Painkiller\" but they ran out of coconut liquor which is a highlight of the drink so I had to settle for the Ginger Peach Julep. A little disappointed because this was the 2nd time this year that I went to Port and they didn't have ingredients for a mixed drink. Womp Womp! The Ginger Peach Julep had Bourbon in it and I clearly wasn't prepared for the taste. As cute as it looked, it tasted absolutely disgusting. All I tasted was ginger and bourbon. I tasted no peach at all. He had a cherry rum and coke which was safe and quite tasty. But really, how can you go wrong with that? \n",
      "\n",
      "Our waiter was a friendly slightly nervous cat who was borderline inappropriate. Y'see, my dude thought the drink I ordered was Ginger Peach Tulip and we had joked around about how it tasted just like straight liquor with nothing else and when the waiter asked how it was, my guy said \"Tastes just like a liquor tulip\" and the waiter said \"ooooh! That's what you do tonight! Lick her two lips. Get it?\"\n",
      "I somehow missed this dialogue and only paid attention after my beau said that was a pervy joke but laughed anyway. Other than that, he was well-behaved\n",
      "\n",
      "We both ordered the same thing \"Butter BBQ Roast Chicken\". We also ordered a glass of Pinot Grigot to go with our meals.  It was quite tasty! A small portion when looking at it at first, but realistically, it didn't need to be bigger. It was satisfying.\n",
      "After dinner, the waiter gave me the nod to confirm I'm ok with them bringing out the cake and 2 min later the yummy Double Chocolate Guinness cake appeared with a Happy Birthday drizzled in caramel. I was relieved that they didn't do the whole singing \"happy birthday\" in a cheesy way type of thing. This restaurant seems like they keep those special moments intimate and private and I could appreciate that. The cake was AMAZING! Way better than I thought it would taste. The soft subtle chocolate/Guinness mix was light and not super sweet, so it completely worked well with the sweeter icing smushed inside the cake. The slice was also rather large!\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was pretty good and even though this is a bit pricier than the average restaurant like Moxies or Milestones, it didn't break the bank. For all of that it was under $150. Not too bad for a Birthday Dinner at all \n",
      "\n",

      "My husband and I went here for our 15th wedding anniversary.  We always go to an Indian restaurant for our anniversary.  We usually have Indian food at an all-vegetarian Indian restaurant in Phoenix, but the food quality has become very inconsistent over the past year. So we searched online for a new restaurant and found Marigold Maison.  We were greeted immediately by (1) Mirnes Mehic, Director of Marketing, as soon as we walked in the door.  I know his name because he stopped by our table and chatted with us after our meal, talking about the restaurant, the chef, the food. He gave us his card.  We were in a corner table which was very cozy even though just about every table was filled.  The décor is lovely.  \n",

Our (3) waitress soon arrived, was very friendly and took our order.  Before we really noticed that our food seemed to be taking a little longer than would be expected, our waitress came to tell us it would be out soon and placed a basket of complimentary papadums on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are vegetarians so we had: Dal Makhani, Saag Paneer, Masala Dosa, Garlic Naan, and Mango Lassi.   The food was excellent!!  Saag Paneer was some of the best we've had.  Masala Dosa was LOADED with potato, Dal Makhani was very flavorful, and the Garlic Naan was fantastic.  We had the leftover Dal and Saag the next day and it was even tastier.   A little warning, the hot sauce that's on the tables is not for the faint of heart. HOT, HOT but very flavorful and you can buy a bottle to take home.\n",
      "\n",
      "During our meal a (4) gentleman came over the refill our drinks and take away any used dishes.  Another (5) lady came over later to remove any more dishes we were finished with.  Our waitress stopped by often to check on us.  Mirnes Mehic stopped by the table and spoke with us.  He stopped by again later to present us with a complementary Mango Kulfi for our anniversary!  As if we hadn't already received enough excellent service, (6) The Chef stopped by our table!  He talked about the ingredients he puts in the foods like olive oil, as well as those he leaves out like ghee, heavy cream, and cashew giving the food a less 'heavy' feeling on the body.\n",

      "First I want to say that our group had an AMAZING time at Encore Beach!!!!!  BUT, we did end up dropping a ton of cash.  If you read the reviews carefully, you'll notice that the people who had the best time are usually the ones who bought a lily pad, or a couch area.  It was a $500 minimum for the couch area by the blackjack tables, but I'm telling you that it was 100% worth it!  We had a bottle of Vodka and ordered some food and it was yummy :)\n",
      "\n",
      "There was one UGLY thing about this place though which is why I removed 1 star, and that is that they don't allow \"oversized\" bags or backpacks and force you to check them for $20!!  $20!!!!  It's insane!  It really pissed off our group at first cause there were 2 of us with big bags, but at least they let us put them together for $20 total.  Jerks.....  I'm sure there's some good reason for not having oversized bags, but they didn't tell us.  One other messed up thing that happened is that we were approached by a promoter the night before after leaving XS and he offered us free admission AND a cabana for free.  We were like, hell yes!!  And then we we get to Encore Beach, the guy isn't around and no one would help us and we were stuck paying for the spot ourselves.  We were pretty pissed about that too, but we didn't let it ruin our time and got over it and just ended up paying.\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, back to the good about this place:  The people are VERY friendly.  Everyone's there to have a good time!  We talked to lots of people and the couple next to us on the couch were awesome!  Overall we just had sooooo much fun!  Great music, dancing in the pool and at our area.  It would not have been as much fun if we didn't pay for that space though.  So suck it up and pay or else stay at your hotel pool (which was also awesome at Aria).\n",

      "Okay- I never write posts, but I feel obligated to do so here. Let me preface by saying I am a FOODIE, I work in the restaurant industry, I live to find great places to eat, and I travel...A LOT.\n",
      "So today I had to drive up to Pittsburgh for work and ended up landing at the Residence Inn in Oakland, PA, because:\n",
      " A. I waited to long to book at the Hampton, and B. Love the Marriot Rewards points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needles to say, I arrived late, tired, and a wee bit dissapointed at my lodging accomodations (the staff makes up for it in friendliness and hospitality).\n",
      "\n",
      " None the less it is time for dinner, and of course the Front Desk is pitching this allegedly \"AMAZING\" italian restaurant (they even had a sign in the lobby)- by the way just accross the street and the ONLY restaurant on the street (and it's not the prettiest of streets mind you). Any of those reading this that travel shares my first thought of \"Danger Danger... Do not eat there!\". \n",
      "\n",
      "But, all they had downstairs were stoffers mac n' cheese, and some chicken chinese stir fry, so I decided to spend some time not catching up on email and take a look at the Zarra's menu online. Once I started reading, the interest of the 2nd generation Italian in me was peaked. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I gave in and gave them a call. Maybe I got lucky... I don't know, but I got the nicest coolest guy on the other end of the line. It goes like this...\n",
      "\"Zarras , Good Evening?\"\n",
      "\"Hi, what time do you close?\"\n",
      "\"Ahh...we're open and seating, what time do you want to eat?\"\n",
      "\"\"Oh I just got in and am staying at the hotel across the street and was checking.\"\n",
      "\"Oh yeah, come on over, we'll gett you seated\"\n",
      "\"Can I order something to be delivered to?\"\n",
      "\"Sure thing we can do that\"\n",
      "\"Ok great, I'll call you right back\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I was so stoked by the non a-hole response that I normally get, where a restaurant sums me up as the 8:45 pm wishy washy annoying last minute order of the evening, that I called back 5 minutes later to order something (even though I realized at that point I wasn't hungry).\n",
      "\n",
      "I will paraphrase this conversation for those that I have lost, am about to lose, or who are just plain annoyed by my endless diatribe (I can't help it! I dig this place!). A lady answered and asked for my order. I asked her what is good and she knew the menu and started rattling things off.\n",
      "\n",
      "We landed on the ricotta pasta with meatballs AND sausage (I'm italian- if they say they make both from scratch- GAME ON), with a side salad w/homemade balsamic.She told me about all of the desserts they make from scratch and extra tidbits of yumminess, but for once I stuck to my guns.Ironically- this was this biggest mistake of my life. I should have ordered one of everything, charged it to my company account, called in sick the next day, and just nurtured an Italian Indulgence/hangover.\n",
      "\n",
      "I decided to walk accross the street and pick up the food. It is a small place in between what I can only describe as row houses (hey, I'm from San Diego and live in DC- give me a break). You walk into this dimly lit but nice and clean front sitting area with a bar. They were folding napkins and closing for the night. I won't go in to detail except to say- Cool, Genuine and Quarky characters. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to sit at the bar and start chatting with everyone working there. A guy in his 30's offered to seat me right away, and then the lady who took my order came over to help me. Everyone was of course Italian and REAL! But the best- an older Gentleman dressed better than any man I've ever dated (owner?) that told me before the restaurant this place was the Electric Banana (I have not researched that yet- assuming an 80's accident in naming vs what I'm thinking). What I got from him, was that he has been the owner since the getgo. I could literally write another 5 pages about just how fun and unique the people are that run this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I left with my food in tow wishing I could hang out and drink with those guys. Came back to my room and started working, forgetting about my meal. SHAME ON ME! Then it hit me and I started unwrapping the 3-time foil-wrapped container (I'm already in love, because red sauce gets everywhere in the bag!). \n",
      "\n",
      "One sniff and one bite- this is like my grandma's, like mine (because my grandma taught me). Meatballs perfect. Ricotta pasta- not what I expected, but in a good way. It's like a gnocchi, but cut like pasta, but different. I dunno- it's good! Dressing delish, like visiting Long Island family. Sausage, chunky with whole fennel seeds...ding ding ding!\n",
      "\n",
      "I only wish I had tried more there. I ordered the ricotta pasta because many of the other items were a bit steep- my only complaint. But with the quality tasted thus far, I can imagine it is well worth it!\n",

      "Note to self- should I stay at the Residence Inn from now on, just so I can eat here? TO BE CONTINUED...\n",

      "I would give this place 3 stars based on tonight, but given that I've been here before, overall i think this place is a solid 4. We were originally guna spend the night at The Rail (but tho my friends called in advance for a reservation, were told not necessary, but yet when we arrived there were no tables) so after a call to Robbie's (which was also booked solid) we called Maddie's and got reservations for 8 ppl at 6:30pm on a Saturday night (week before Christmas). We were seated quickly but several other tables arrived almost simultaneously and we were asked to wait very respectfully by our awesome waiter Eric several times before our orders were actually taken (we didn't mind we were enjoying each other's company). The fun thing about Maddies is 1- you get to go pick ur own bottle of wine (which are of above-average prices) and 2- if you're a smoker: u get to smoke indoors. So getting on with it, service my gawd: amazing !! Last time me and t friends were served by Jeff (we loved Jeff he was a super awesome waiter no longer there -- if u know where he's gone please message me 'cuz we will go there!) This time we had Eric who was fantastic and soooooo charming! (And handsome ;) ) What an excellent waiter: he did awesome considering he was dealing with a staff, restaurant and stock that had had an unexpected surplus of clientele the previous night that had all but obliterated the quantity available of wines and foods making his job as a waiter most precarious. He didn't charge us for most of our sides and bought us a round of shots at the end, in return we tipped him quite merry Christmas generously but he did well in what he did because had it not been for him this place would have easily scored 2 stars tonight and we likely would never re-consider it for future outings despite having greatly enjoyed our last visit because of their lack of staff and lack of supplies making this visit so close to disastrous it was ONLY SAVED BY OUR WAITER- I cannot emphasize that enough. I had the Rib Roast beef, i ordered medium rare, it was a tad more on the rare side but i didn't complain because it was still phenomenal. Most of my friends who ordered beef of some cut had the same problem slightly more rare than medium rare, slightly more medium rare than medium but we all still enjoyed our plates. The carrots were unfortunately way under-cooked though and i did let them know. Overall our meal took 2.5 hours but we enjoyed it thoroughly. We will still be going back to this place again.\n",

The menu is nice and concise consisting of a snacks/apps section, an entrée section, and desserts.  There is also a tasting menu of $40 per person which includes an appetizer, an entrée, a dessert, as well as an amuse-bouche and a pre-dessert from the chef.

We tried both the sushi and American items on the menu. The sushi was mediocre at best.  There was too much cilantro on the Hamachi which was not the freshest. The  crudo at Chinato is miles better.

The girls at the hostess area/computer/thing just don't seem to have any desire to assist. My wife and I had a reservation tonight for 7:45. Our plans changed and we arrived early, around 6. We asked if we could be seated earlier, and they said no problem. Here it is, 7:05, and plenty of people have walked in and been seated after we came in. I walked up around 6:30, and they said it would be a \"couple\" minutes. As my wife and I sit here and see the empty clean tables, that have been empty and clean since we arrived, I myself am beginning to wonder if we slipped through the cracks or something. I must have forgot to take off my invisibility cloak or something. All 4 of these ladies are just standing there, talking and chatting, and help more people as they come in, and get seated.

He apologized profusely and took our order immediately. Our own waitress came by and apologized and ensured us she'd be helping us. The manager then came over without us requesting, apologized again, and told us he would comp the entire meal and to be sure to order dessert.

I have tried so many different things from the menu and it never disappoints, but the Saturday night special Prime Rib and Horseradish Dauphinoise Potato is my favorite. Second, the service is amazing. Ian is my favorite waiter, will request him every time! He is so personable with a good sense of humor! He constantly is checking up to make sure everything is good (but not too much). He made the experience at the...  \n",

Drink orders were placed, and when our margaritas arrived, they were really, really off and tasted terrible.

       "4     Our first stop in a wild bachelor party weekend around the Phoenix area. After doing some research for lunch I decided on the arrogant butcher. What a great name for a restaurant located in downtown Phoenix directly across from the Arizona Diamondbacks ball park. With a solid 4 stars and over 1200 reviews it had to be outstanding right? Unfortunately the arrogance overcame the actual experience that we received. Arriving during happy hour the restaurant was extremely dead, but spring break, ...  \n",

We got there just before the lunch rush and scored a prime table near the windows (tho upon leaving, my friend noted how cozy the sofa-bench tables looked, so I'll aim for one of those next time). Our server, Robert, made even the soup of the day (tomato bisque) sound out of this world.

I prefer my scallops with more of a high heat sear on the outside but a little rare on the inside. My boyfriend had the prime rib French dip sandwich served with fries for $19.

I came here for dinner and got the turkey sloppy joe- tasty but a little dry. For dessert I got the peanut butter gelato/cookie combo and it was to die for. Waitress did try to push the charcuterie plate (what they're \"known for\") but didn't seem appetizing at the time. Great place to stop  by if you're in the Phoenix area.  \n",

Next time if I'm in Phoenix again, I'll go for a steak and re-review, but if they specialize in steaks then maybe they shouldn't be fiddling with other foods they don't know how to do as well.

However, drinks seem to take forever, and often are not correct. They just cannot coordinate the food with the beverage, nor at any pace other than fast food. That is consistent after many v...  \n",

The bartender that served us was nice, but it was weird that she never gave us any eye contact when we ordered.

      "I spent four nights in downtown Phoenix at a conference this past week, and I only got out of the depressing conference hotel a few times, for off-campus dinners. On Friday night, I walked over to The Arrogant Butcher with four friends, and we had a nice meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was actually our second choice, but apparently you can't just walk into Blue Hound on a Friday night and expect to plonk down at a large table. We had passed The Arrogant Butcher on our walk over, and it looked spacious and charming, so we went back. (It later became apparent that everyone from this conference ate at this restaurant at some point or another.) There was a short wait--twenty minutes, if that--which we spent at the wide-open bar. We could've eaten there too if we were a smaller group, but were happy to get a comfortable table at a corner of the restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoyed the place. I feel like I've been to a lot of restaurants that might as well be called The Arrogant Butcher and liked them all. This one was in line with the rest--meat-centric menu, lightly throwback Ron-Swanson-for-Pottery-Barn decor--and very obviously established in the last five or so years. Somewhere, there's a restaurateur Pinterest board that creates this exact restaurant. Service was solid, both at bar and table. We ordered food in a couple waves and did an interesting check split, and our server handled everything well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a cocktail to start and a beer with my dinner, and both were great. The Snakeskin Boots was a lovely drink made with Maestro Dobel tequila, Ancho Reyes, Cointreau, citrus, and smashed lime, garnished with a shishito (or other mild/green/little) pepper. It was very well balanced with a pleasant kick. The Four Peaks Kilt Lifter was a nice Scottish ale that took me through dinner and, it should be noted, the entire conference--this beer is everywhere in Phoenix, and I adore it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was solid, the menu stacked with gastropub/trendy new American fare. We split a few hearty appetizers, and these were pretty good. The house soft pretzels were nice, fresh and fluffy bites--like donut holes but for pretzels-- served with a rich provolone fondue. The artichoke hummus was also great, smooth and flavorful, the hummus cut with artichoke, olive, and tomato and served with flatbread. Then there was the Butcher's Platter, an assortment of the chef's favorite charcuterie-type items of the day. This came with deviled eggs, smoked salmon rillettes, bacon-wrapped sweet potato, a few cured meats, a spot of cheese, olives, pistachios, a few condiments, and a bread plate. The deviled eggs were a definite highlight, topped with crispy prosciutto bits, and I also liked the sweet potato and stuffed peppers. The meat and cheese weren't anything special on their own, but the house mustard was great. The bread plate was kind of strange--the crusty bread was drizzled with a startlingly salty balsamic drizzle, and the only other option was greasy madeleines, not exactly pile-with-charcuterie bread.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the appetizers, everyone got their own salads. I'm not really a salad person, but I was the last one at the table to order, and everyone else had gotten a salad, so you tell me--WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? I didn't want to get the only $30 entree at the table, so I went with the crowd and ate healthy. It wasn't a bad choice. I ordered the roasted beet salad with a filet of grilled salmon on top, which gave it some substance. The salmon was excellent, moist and flaky with a good grilled char. The salad was good too, the roasted beets mixed with grilled corn, green bean, asparagus, caramelized fennel, pistachio, manchego, and crispy prosciutto. All the ingredients were fresh and tasty, and they came together well, particularly with a full meal's worth of salmon on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a great time at The Arrogant Butcher. This dinner was one of the only exciting food outings in a five-day trip, and I appreciated my brief escape from the Hyatt Regency. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal in this part of Phoenix. Even if you get a salad, you can't go too wrong.\n",
      "I have very mixed feelings about the Arrogant Butcher. Four visits on varying occasions have each resulted in different experiences and levels of satisfaction. I love the atmosphere and the overall experience, but the lack of consistency is noticeable and I have heard similar criticisms from friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "My first trip to AB was for drinks and a snack during a break from a sporting event downtown. I went over alone (to escape) ordered a Manhattan and an appetizer. The Manhattans were perfect (who stops at one?), and the charcuterie and cheese were terrific and served with some unique accoutrements. However, it was some time before I was able to order that first drink, and in fact, almost left after waiting at the bar for quite some time without acknowledgement - and there were only about 5 other patrons nearby. Once I did get someone's attention, everything was brilliant, but I can never understand a bartender not promptly taking a drink order.\n",
      "\n",
      "My succeeding trip was very similar to the first, waited at the bar with a friend for an inordinate amount of time before finally having our drink and order of cheese and some appetizers taken. The restaurant was not particularly busy and the bar staff was sort of milling around chatting rather than trying to make money by serving the two thirsty girls in front of them. Once we had our (very well crafted) beverages in hand, everything went swimmingly. This place does a stand out job of mixology and the bartenders, while less than attentive, do know how to make a great drink. \n",
      "\n",
      "Third visit - dinner date (no worries boys, it didn't go that well): Service was wonderful in the restaurant and I wish I could recall the waiter's name. We ordered a couple appetizers again went for charcuterie and cheese. The stand out for me was the pate - then again, I am always a sucker for pate. My dinner date had a steak and I had the sweet potato tortellini, which was simply wonderful. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth visit - birthday party for ten. This was again a super mixed experience. The restaurant seated us in a private room in the back, which was decorated with some very cool photos of Phoenicianicana. I was a little late in arriving so the crew had already devoured several appetizers and a plethora of oysters. From what I heard the mussels were a big hit and they liked the cheese plate as much as I did. The waiter was super nice, answered questions, took our orders and kept everyone's glass full. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dinner was a bit of a mess. Two of the guys ordered steaks with the $18 crab add on for a surf and turf, one filet and one rib eye, both of which came out overcooked. One of the gals ordered the crab, and the waiter came and explained it had 'fallen apart' so they were bringing a new one. They did fix the errors, but it is ever so awkward to have part of your party finished with dinner while others are waiting on theirs to show up. I ordered the scallops and they were perfectly cooked, but I had to bite through sand in about half of them, which is just a bummer. After we'd already had so many issues I didn't want to add to the aggravation in sending something else back to the kitchen. \n",
      "\n",
      "The GM did come see us, apologized and brought out a round of deserts. In a nice effort he brought two of each of the four desserts on the menu, which we all tried out. The stand out for me was the salted caramel pudding. No one really understood the warm peanut butter gelato, which essentially tasted like peanut butter soup. We were having a good time and we did appreciate the manager and waiter's efforts to apologize and take care of the issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arrogant Butcher has a pretty sweet little happy hour menu and now that my office is now less than ten minutes away, I will probably be stopping back in to check that out and am certain I will eat here again. I just wish they could regularly be as great as I know they can be.\n",

      "Our menu so far: house made pretzels and provolone fondue, sweet potato tortelli, roasted beet salad, montchevre (goat Brie), chicken stroganoff, smoked pork Cubano, turkey pastrami, French fries, a kids grilled ham and cheese sandwich, a kids chicken tenders, the \"hot chocolate\" cake, and pumpkin cheesecake with pomegranate compote. \n",
      "\n",
      "Pretzels: yes, just get them. Perfectly cooked and brined, and that provolone has a flavor something of magic. If you can't go for some German bread paired with Swiss/Italian/French melted cheese, well, that's just un-American. \n",
      "\n",
      "Montchevre: still not a fan of goat cheese. My friend liked it quite well, however. \n",
      "\n",
      "Roasted beet salad: surprisingly amazing!  I'm not a huge food risk taker, but I do consider myself a foodie, and I'm trying to take more risks with my palette. This was just perfectly combined: roasted beet for a base (first time eating beets, do it here. It was mine, too), Brussel sprouts for depth, pistachios for crunch, prosciutto and accompany sauce for flavor and pomegranates for balance. Seriously, so well dreamed up. I'll definitely be getting it again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sweet potato tortelli: not usually a huge sweet potato fan, but I also really loved this. The mushroom and spinach balanced the sweet potato along with the lemon butter type sauce.  The hazelnuts added a touch of flare and texture. So good!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cubano: such an interesting sandwich with deli thin ham slices alongside smoked pork, topped in a cheddar cheese, (usually Swiss), and had a bit of a kick in flavor. Served in a sturdy folded bread like a panini, I'd say. It was good, but compared to the other items we've had, it's a little forgettable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Turkey pastrami: that's what good turkey tastes like. First time trying it as a pastrami, but had same flavoring without feeling heavy. The coleslaw was crunchy and had a great sauce inside. The pretzel bun was perfectly portioned not to overwhelm the sandwich. Suggest eating it upside down to allow the ingredients to soak into the top bun as well. Supposedly their best selling sandwich, and I'd have to say, I'm not surprised and would definitely order it again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Stroganoff: the handmade egg noodles were brilliantly made and perfectly cooked al dente.  The peas tasted fresh and added a little sweetness to a savory dish. The chicken was so tender and flavorful. Never had a chicken stroganoff, but once again the bird made it feel like a lighter meal without sacrificing the savory element you expect from a stroganoff. Just enough sauce, not swimming. Filled with mushrooms - great flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Grilled ham and cheese and chicken tenders - predictable, but well received by the kiddos. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fries: sandwiches both came with it - wasn't expecting that. Awesome crisp with soft and airy interior. Cooked in truffle oil?  Something, because they had a different, but yummy flavor. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hot chocolate\" cake: made Swiss miss hot cocoa. Pictures something sweet, but it was more of a rich chocolate cake. Almost a brownie flavor with more of a lighter texture (oddly enough, like a soggy cake texture, but in a good way). \n",
      "\n",
      "Cheesecake: who would have thought pumpkin with pomegranate, but that should just be a permanent thing, since it works so darn well. The cheesecake was lighter and fluffier than a traditional cheesecake, but still good. Topped with a pomegranate seed compote - so good. Finished with some granola style crumble - again, so good. Winter seasonal dessert - switches to blueberry in the summer months. \n",
      "\n",
      "Desserts are $6 and are on the smaller side, but still enough to share and portioned in a size that even after a meal, you can make room to share one or a couple. \n",
      "\n",
      "Will be trying the warm peanut butter cup (should have fought harder to try that) and salted caramel pudding in a few weeks (voted best dessert in Phoenix recently). \n",

      "Definitely a new favorite for when we find ourselves in town.\n",
      "A fried egg?  With Green Chile?  Okay, well, I'm feeling open-minded, which does not often happen with Green Chile, so I go for it.  To be fair, it seems like every time a Chef wants to differentiate, he tosses a fried egg on it, \"There!  Magnifique!\"  Well, okay, this time it works.  I am a green-chile snob and I fall in the camp of \"it's not chile if it has beans in it\", so again, dubious about this concoction of Short-Rib Green Chile stew, I tried it anyway.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The yolk from the perfectly cooked sunny-side up egg blended into the chile, quickly disappearing while adding a rich texture to the savory sauce.  For me, the chile spice was a bit mild, although it did have a pleasant afterburn that let you know this was a southwestern dish.  This was a thick stew of tender beef, beans and chiles served with a moist, buttery cornbread muffin on the side.  While I could dicker about the ingredients, I cannot argue that it was not tasty, albeit a bit on the salty side.  Washed down with a smooth Kiltlifter Scottish Ale from Four Peaks was a perfect choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife had the Chicken Stroganoff, a pappardelle noodle dish with a sauce that reminded her of Coq au Vin.  Peas and mushrooms complimented the sliced chicken, making this dish a winner.  Youngest daughter had grilled Salmon with fried potatoes and had no complaints.  It's difficult to get any sort of description from the young ones, so as long as she liked it, which she did, I consider it a winner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kids had the salted caramel pudding dessert and raved about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one thing that was a big negative for me was the service.  Impersonal is the word that comes to mind.  \"Hands-off\" is a phrase that comes to mind.  While the server did his job adequately, he was slow at everything, and did not check back until we were practically done with our meal.  I wish he could have been more present.\n",

      "We're a group of healthcare professionals (NPs, PAs, and MDs) that meet every month to catch up and decompress from our crazy jobs; there's about 8 of us. We arrived a bit early yesterday for happy hour, only to find that happy hour was cancelled due to the Rush concert at US Airways. Who cancels a published happy hour? So clearly, they just wanted to make more money off of the concertgoers with no regard to the typical customer. We ordered drinks for the lot, only to be asked every 20 seconds to get out of the way of the serving staff because the place was so packed and there was barely even standing room. There was no way to not be in the way. We got seated on the patio (because an inside table was a 2-hour wait) pretty quickly. However, the misters were broken at the table we were seated at - they worked fine at all of the other patio tables, but not ours. There didn't seem to be any regard for the fact that it was 107°. We asked to be reseated, they said they couldn't accommodate us anywhere else. We asked about a group of 2-tops that were available, were told they were reserved. I offered to sit at the table with the broken misters until something else opened up, but they said they didn't know how long it'd be before another table opened up. We were pretty much ready to leave (I had said we'd just pick up some wine and go back to my place to make pizzas) when the \"reserved\" 2-tops suddenly became available and were rearranged to accommodate us. The server acted like we were a complete bother to him, like he'd rather be somewhere else with a different group of people. Really didn't engage us very much. The appetizers were fantastic (shrimp and pretzels) and were gone in a heartbeat. Three of the eight of us ordered the prime rib. I joked that I didn't even want mine cooked (i.e., as rare as possible), and the server told me it was already cooked and my request was not possible. I was kidding, of course, but it wasn't received very well. When our food came, only one of us was given horseradish to accompany our prime rib. When I asked for horseradish for the other two, the server said, \"oh, you want more?\" No, I want SOME. I would say my prime rib was medium-rare at best. It was OK, pretty fatty, but that's a risk you take with prime rib, I suppose. I was going to order another glass of wine, but I couldn't get the attention of the server and he didn't come back to the table to check up on us very frequently. When he brought me a to-go box, I had asked for more au jus and horseradish to-go, so he brought me an empty container to put my remnants in instead of fulfilling my request of new. We usually meet at 6:00 and don't leave until about 9 or 10, usually sit around and have a few drinks while we chat. But this time, we all left by 8 and all went our separate ways. The consensus among the group was that we wouldn't be back, individually or as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been here before and enjoyed myself, but I really won't be back after yesterday's experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "UPDATE 9/7/2015: Chelsea, manager, messaged me for my phone number to talk about my experience. I sent it to her. Haven't heard a word back. Moot point, really, as it doesn't change my opinion about the place for better or worse. Just solidifies it.\n",
      "This place is ok, nothing special.  I have been here 4 times, 3 times for lunch and recently for dinner.  I know this place is always busy and can get pretty crowded, but I'm baffled on why.  The location is awesome, its literally across the street from the US Airways arena, and there's alot going on in this block.  The ambiance is really nice, and they have some really cool photo's around the place, but as you know what I say, It's all about the food.  The prices are pretty high and the food and portions are nothing to brag about.  We arrived on a Saturday night, it was 10 of us.  We made a reservation at 6:00 and we're seated right away.  The service was pretty poor, but since we had a big group, figured there would be more than one waiter for our table.  We ordered some appetizers which we split and my lady ordered the Chicken stuffed with crab with a side of potatoes.  I ordered the Fish and Chips.  I hear some really positive reviews about their pretzels and fondue, but I thought it was gross.  We were all talking and chatting, and by the time we dived in the fondue, it developed a thick layer on top, which you commonly see from processed cheese like Velveeta, and when I dipped the pretzel it pulled the thick layer with it. That's why its under a fire, cause soon when it gets room temperature, it hardened up.  Not impressed at all, but if you like Velveeta, you might like their fondue.  The meat and cheese board was a joke, and the hummus was bland.  The main course arrived.  Since I had a horrible experience with my last fish and Chips (The Codfather) I felt I needed something to redeem my last experience.  The fish and chips were pretty good.  I requested some tartar sauce, not this ranch cr*p they gave me and malt vinegar, but it never arrived.  So I just ate it plain. My lady ordered the Chicken stuff with crab dish.  Like I read in a previous post, I have no clue what it was stuffed with, cause it sure wasn't crab.  It was like minced crab if anything else.  Really disappointing dish, especially for that price.\n",
      "\n",
      "Food=C.  Very mediocre.  Portions are small and very little creativity.  Appetizers were terrible and quality of the ingredients are poor.  I have no clue what that chicken was stuffed with.  If I had to bet, it was minced crab out of a can.  Terrible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service=D.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  We had 10 people in our group and he tried to accommodate everybody, but clearly couldn't handle the group.  I had to request my drink to be refilled several times and it took a while to get it filled.  I asked for lemons for my lady, it never arrived.  I asked for Tartar sauce and Malt Vinegar, that never arrived either.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not impressed with The Arrogant Butcher.  I've been to several FOX concepts restaurants but this one is probably the worst.  Culinary Dropout is a close second.   I do like North a lot though.  Maybe I'll just stick to that one.\n",

To put it kindly, this restaurant has fantastic decor, but is an upgraded version of Applebee's. The filet was pathetic, the pasta was overcooked and the service was about as good as visiting an Applebee's or worse. I feel bad for the residents, who seem to think this is high class food.

Fries are just slightly \"overdone\"...just the way I like them.  Servers are always pleasant and attentive.  The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars from me are the hostesses.  Every time I come here (about 1-2 times a week) the hostess seems confused on where to seat people.  I know it's only a couple minutes but the place can be empty and you're going to wait there while the confused hostess stand figures out where to seat you.\n",

When I asked them to turn it to something that wouldn't kill my brain cells or to turn it off, they put on ESPN news--not a game. The meat and cheese platter was very good. My husband and son had steaks which they said were average. I had the pork and beans which were really good, but overpriced. The peanut butter cup was \"to-die-for!\" Every one of their desserts had nuts in them and my son  is allergic to all tree nuts, so nothing for him.
